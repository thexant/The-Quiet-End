# GOAL
- The goal is to enhance the existing sub-location implementations so that each sub-location has at least one interactive element. Some elements within sub-locations can still be simple narrative/roleplay things but each sub-location should have something more interactive or to do.
- Each sub-location implementation should be accurate to the existing codebase and utilize exsiting functions, rather than making new ones up on assumption.
- Each sub-location implementation should be themed to the game and accurate to the styling and lore

## Rules
- Anything that charges the players ingame money should state that it will cost money beforehand
- Sub location implementations should strive to be unique, or at least SEEM unique between different sub-location types.
- The implementation should take existing features and functionality into account instead of making up new ones

- database.py is our current implementation, postgresql_database.py is old
